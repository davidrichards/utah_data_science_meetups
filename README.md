# Utah County Data Science Meetup March 24, 2016

These are my notes.  A few of them could be cleaned up or broken into different notebooks.  The Basic Decision Tree is the main example, working with data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).  It uses only a DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit learn, but explores the nature of that algorithm fairly well using practical data.
